Create a clean, modern, and responsive website for a Bangladeshi education guide app named "Guide of Every Class," focusing on education guides for classes 1 to 10. The app should feel friendly, helpful, and calming, using a color palette of green and white (symbolizing peace and growth), Bengali-style fonts (e.g., Noto Serif Bengali), and elements reflecting Bangladesh (e.g., rivers, nature, or landmarks). The website should prioritize a mobile-first, lag-free design with smooth animations, large touch-friendly buttons, and a stunning UI featuring calming effects like floating stars, subtle gradients, and interactive hover effects. All text and UI must be multilingual-ready (English and Bengali) with seamless language switching. Use Tailwind CSS for styling and simple HTML/JavaScript for layout and functionality, optimizing for performance to minimize lag.

Homepage Requirements:
Welcome Section: Feature a large, bold title and subtitle introducing the app, with a welcoming tone.
Featured Background: Use a high-quality, calming background image related to Bangladesh (e.g., Padma River, Sundarbans, or tea gardens), optimized for fast loading.
Buttons: Include fully functional buttons for:
Browse Guides: Scrolls to the classes section.
Download PDF: Placeholder for downloading a sample PDF (to be replaced later).
Contact: Opens a modal or alert for contact (placeholder for future form).
Categories Section: Display 10 categories (Class 1 to Class 10) as interactive cards with a ‘Coming Soon’ placeholder, using subtle hover animations (e.g., scale or shadow effects).
Footer: Include copyright, social media links (Facebook, Twitter, Instagram), and a "Made in Bangladesh with ❤️" label, styled to match the theme.
Class and Subject Navigation:
Clicking a class (e.g., Class 1) displays a subjects section, dynamically populated from a guides.json file.
The JSON file should include:
id: Class identifier (e.g., "class1", "class2", ..., "class10").
subjects: Array of subjects, each with:
name: Subject name (e.g., Bangla, English, Math, Science, Social Studies).
version: "Bangla" or "English".
file_path: Path to the PDF in the guides folder (e.g., "guides/class1_bangla.pdf").
After clicking a class, display subjects in two sections:
Bangla Version: A header-like section (styled like a sticky footer) followed by Bangla-medium subject cards.
English Version: A header-like section after Bangla subjects, followed by English-medium subject cards.
Clicking a subject displays a placeholder PDF viewer (for PDFs to be added later) with a clean, centered iframe.
Optimize navigation to prevent lag by using efficient DOM manipulation and lazy-loading cards where applicable.
Additional Features:
Theme Toggle: Implement a dark/light theme toggle that works consistently across all pages/sections, storing the preference in localStorage for persistence. Use Tailwind’s dark mode classes for seamless transitions.
Home Button: Add a functional home button in the header, working on all pages/sections to return to the homepage.
Bookmark/Favorite Guides:
Allow users to bookmark guides by clicking a "Bookmark" button on subject cards.
Store bookmarks in localStorage and display them in a dedicated "Bookmarked Guides" section, accessible via a button or menu.
Include a "Remove Bookmark" option on bookmarked guides.
Guides Folder: Reference a guides folder for storing PDFs, with guides.json linking to these files.
Enhanced UI:
Add calming effects like floating stars (using CSS animations) and subtle gradients in backgrounds or cards.
Implement interactive hover effects (e.g., card scaling, shadow growth, or color shifts) for a polished look.
Use smooth scroll behavior and transitions for section changes to enhance user experience.
Multilingual Support:
Implement a language toggle (English/Bengali) that updates all text/UI instantly using data-en and data-bn attributes.
Ensure font rendering for Bengali (Noto Serif Bengali) is crisp and legible.
Search Functionality:
Add a search bar to filter classes or subjects dynamically, updating results in real-time without page reloads.
Highlight matching results with subtle animations.
Guide Previews:
Include a "Preview" button on subject cards to show a modal with a brief description or placeholder text about the guide.
Progress Tracking:
Allow users to mark guides as "Completed" or "In Progress" with a simple status toggle, stored in localStorage.
Display progress in the bookmarked guides section (e.g., a progress badge on cards).
Performance Optimizations:
Lazy-load images and cards outside the viewport to reduce initial load time.
Minimize JavaScript by debouncing event listeners and using efficient DOM queries.
Compress and optimize the background image to reduce lag without sacrificing quality.
Additional Creative Features:
Add a "Recently Viewed" section to show the last 3–5 guides accessed, stored in localStorage.
Include a subtle notification system (e.g., toast messages) for actions like bookmarking or switching themes.
Add a "Quick Tips" section with educational tips or motivational quotes, styled as a carousel or static cards.
Implement a sticky navigation bar for easy access to Home, Bookmarks, and Search across all sections.
JSON File Structure:
Create a guides.json file with:

id: Class identifier (e.g., "class1", "class2", ..., "class10").
subjects: Array of subjects, each with:
name: Subject name (e.g., Bangla, English, Math, Science, Social Studies).
version: "Bangla" or "English".
file_path: Path to the PDF in the guides folder (e.g., "guides/class1_bangla.pdf").
description: Brief description for preview (e.g., "Comprehensive Bangla guide for Class 1").
Fixes and Improvements:
Ensure the dark/light theme toggle works seamlessly across all sections, with no visual glitches.
Fix the home button to consistently return to the homepage from any section (classes, subjects, PDF viewer, bookmarks).
Remove unnecessary elements (e.g., unused buttons or redundant sections) to keep the design clean and focused.
Enhance attractiveness with:
Subtle gradients in card backgrounds or buttons for depth.
Interactive hover effects like card tilting or glowing borders.
Calming animations like fading transitions or pulsating buttons.
A cohesive color scheme with shades of green (e.g., #10B981, #059669) and soft whites/grays.
Optimize for performance by:
Using requestAnimationFrame for animations.
Avoiding heavy DOM operations during scrolls or clicks.
Caching JSON data to reduce fetch calls.
Technical Requirements:
Use Tailwind CSS for styling, leveraging its utility classes for responsiveness and dark mode.
Use simple HTML and JavaScript for layout and functionality, avoiding heavy frameworks.
Store PDFs in a guides folder, referenced in guides.json.
Ensure all buttons (Browse Guides, Download PDF, Contact, Home, Theme Toggle, Bookmark, Search) are fully functional.
Use placeholder cards with ‘Coming Soon’ text for guides until PDFs are added.
Avoid <form> elements due to sandbox restrictions; use className for JSX compatibility if applicable.
Ensure compatibility with modern browsers, with fallbacks for older ones.
